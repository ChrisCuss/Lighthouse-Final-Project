## Project Title:
Customer Segmentation for Siempre Tequila Sales Enhancement

## Goal:
The goal of this project is to boost Siempre Tequila's customer engagement and sales strategies by employing advanced machine learning to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. By understanding distinct customer groups, we aim to enable more personalized sales approaches, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty, and ultimately driving sales growth.

## Project Description:
Facing challenges in engaging customers efficiently, this project seeks to leverage Siempre Tequila’s extensive dataset on customer transactions and sales. We will use unsupervised learning, specifically k-means clustering, to segment the customer base into unique groups characterized by their buying habits and preferences. This strategic segmentation will uncover various customer types, empowering the sales team to tailor their strategies and communications effectively for each group. The initiative is set to improve customer experiences, foster loyalty, and stimulate sales expansion by catering to the specific needs and preferences of each segment.

## Data Utilization:
To achieve our objectives, we will analyze Siempre Tequila’s rich customer and sales data, which includes:

- **SKU, Country, State/Province/Market**: Details on product sales across different regions.
- **Date, Market Manager**: Time-related data and managerial oversight.
- **Cost of Goods Sold, Sell Price, Profit, Profit Margin**: Key financial sales metrics.

- **Tequila Tastings, Distributor Size, Market Type**: Insights into marketing and distribution.

Utilizing this comprehensive dataset, we aim to deeply understand and segment Siempre Tequila’s customer base, laying the groundwork for targeted sales strategies and marketing initiatives.
